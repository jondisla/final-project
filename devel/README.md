# Instructions for Running my Project

Replace this text with the instructions your classmates will need to run your project. If your code needs any libraries using `pip` or any other tool, those instructions should be here as well. A complete stranger should be able to follow these instructions, so don't be afraid to include videos, screenshots, diagrams, text, whatever helps!

1. Open the the devel folder
2. Goto the "Final Project.py" file and open in the python shell
2. Run the program
3. Very simple, you don't need any extras
4. Follow the prompts on the screen

Thanks for trying my personality test.
